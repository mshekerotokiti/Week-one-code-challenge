WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
 This is a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This is a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This is a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
